way was needed to prevent Active Directory userNames from being recycled and showing data to the wrong person.\r\n\r\nPotential Impact:\r\nCurrently there are userNames that have already been recycled. These will get missed and need to be done manually when they come up.\r\nDisabling a user one at a time will use the same process but re-enabling them needs to be programmed yet.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nThis will need to be done on staging. It is possible to set up local to do this I think but it is not currently done. Staging should be set and ready to do this.\r\nTo test just run the refreshOrgchartEmployees.php. All instances of userNames in all tables that store the userName in both the orgchart and any portals for that orgchart should be updated to the new format.
